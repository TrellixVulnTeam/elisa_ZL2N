.. v0.1_: https://github.com/mikecokina/elisa/commits/release/0.1


**Features**


* **binary system modeling**

    - points surface generation from generalized surface potential
    - triangulation (faces creation) of component`s surface points
    - physical quantities (gravity, temperatures) distribution over component surface (faces)
    - surface spots
    - temperature pulsations effect
    - light curves modeling for circular synchronous/asynchronous orbits with spotty/no-spotty components
    - radial velocity curves based on movement of center of mass

* **binary system visualization**

    - surface points plot
    - surface wire mesh plot
    - surface faces plot with visualization of distribution of physical quantities
    - orbit plot
    - animations of orbital motions

* **in progress/pending**
